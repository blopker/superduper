# Privacy Policy for SuperDuper App

**Effective Date: May 4th, 2025**

## Introduction

This Privacy Policy applies to the SuperDuper mobile application (the "App") developed by SuperDuper Team ("we", "our", or "us"). This policy describes how we handle your data and is designed to inform users about our commitment to privacy.

As developers of SuperDuper, we believe in transparency about how our app functions and what information it does and does not collect. We have designed SuperDuper with privacy in mind.

## Data Controller

SuperDuper Team is the data controller responsible for your personal information collected through the App.

## Information Collection and Use

SuperDuper is designed to connect to your ebike via Bluetooth. The app is designed to work offline and does not require an internet connection or user account.

### Data We Do Not Collect

- No personal information (name, email, phone number, etc.)
- No location tracking or location history
- No usage statistics
- No advertising identifiers
- No analytics data
- No browsing history

### Data Stored on Your Device Only

The following information is stored locally on your device only and is never transmitted to us or any third parties:

- Bluetooth information about your ebike(s) to enable connection
- Custom bike names you create
- Your preferred bike settings

### Legal Basis for Processing

We process the limited data described above based on our legitimate interest to provide you with the functionality of the App as described.

### Data Retention and Deletion

All data is stored locally on your device only. This data is retained as long as you have the App installed on your device. When you uninstall the App, all data associated with the App is automatically deleted. We do not retain any of your data on our servers, as we do not collect any data from your device.

If you wish to delete your data before uninstalling the App, you can clear the App's data through your device's settings menu:
- On Android: Settings > Apps > SuperDuper > Storage > Clear Data
- On iOS: Settings > General > iPhone Storage > SuperDuper > Delete App

### Data Security

We implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to protect the data that is stored locally on your device. However, no method of electronic storage is 100% secure. While we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your personal data, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.

## Required App Store Data

The only data that may be collected is that which is automatically collected by the Apple App Store and Google Play Store as part of their standard operations. This includes:

- App crash reports (if you choose to share them)
- Basic installation metrics
- App store download statistics

This information is collected by Apple and Google, not by SuperDuper, and is subject to their respective privacy policies:
- [Google Privacy Policy](https://policies.google.com/privacy)
- [Apple Privacy Policy](https://www.apple.com/legal/privacy/)

## Permissions

SuperDuper requests the following permissions:

- **Bluetooth**: Required to connect to your ebike
- **Location** (Android only): Required by Android's system for Bluetooth scanning. We do not track, collect, or store your location information.
- **Background processing** (for Android Background Lock feature): Required to maintain Bluetooth connection when the app is in the background.

These permissions are used solely for the functionality of the app and not for data collection purposes.

## Third-Party Services

The App does not use any third-party analytics, advertising, or tracking services.

## Data Transfers

The App does not transfer any personal data to third parties or across borders.

## Children's Privacy

SuperDuper does not knowingly collect any personally identifiable information from children under 13 years of age. The App does not target children under the age of 13. If you are a parent or guardian and you believe your child has provided us with personal information, please contact us so we can take necessary actions.

## Your Rights

Depending on your jurisdiction, you may have certain rights regarding your personal information. Since we do not collect any personal information, most of these rights are automatically fulfilled. However, you still have the right to:

- Access: View what data is stored locally on your device through the App's interface.
- Delete: Uninstall the App or clear its data through your device settings.
- Complain: Contact the relevant data protection authority if you believe your rights have been violated.

## Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page and updating the "Effective Date" at the top of this Privacy Policy. Changes to this Privacy Policy are effective when they are posted.

## Open Source
