# Terms and Conditions for SuperDuper App

**Effective Date: May 4th, 2025**

## Introduction

By downloading or using SuperDuper, these terms will automatically apply to you. Please read them carefully before using the app. SuperDuper is an open source alternative ebike app available for iOS and Android platforms.

## Intellectual Property

SuperDuper is an open source application, with its source code available at [https://github.com/blopker/superduper](https://github.com/blopker/superduper). The app is licensed under open source licensing terms that can be found in the repository. While the app is open source, the project name, logos, and branding elements are protected by intellectual property rights.

You're welcome to examine and modify the source code according to the applicable open source license, but you may not misrepresent the app as your own or use the SuperDuper brand in a way that implies endorsement.

## App Functionality and Changes

SuperDuper is committed to providing a useful and efficient app for controlling compatible ebikes. For that reason, we reserve the right to make changes to the app at any time and for any reason. SuperDuper is provided free of charge and will remain so.

## Device Security

SuperDuper connects to ebikes using Bluetooth technology. It's your responsibility to keep your phone and access to the app secure. We recommend that you do not jailbreak or root your phone, which could compromise your device's security and may cause SuperDuper to function improperly or not at all.

## Third-Party Services

The app may use third-party services that declare their own Terms and Conditions, including:

* [Google Play Services](https://policies.google.com/terms)
* [Apple App Store Services](https://www.apple.com/legal/internet-services/itunes/)

## Limitations of Liability

SuperDuper is provided "as is" without warranty of any kind. The developers of SuperDuper cannot take responsibility for:

- The app not working at full functionality if you don't have proper Bluetooth connectivity
- Any battery consumption on your device while using the app
- Any issues arising from improper use of the app
- Any damage or modifications to your ebike resulting from use of the app

By using SuperDuper, you accept that connecting to and controlling your ebike is done at your own risk. The developers accept no liability for any loss, direct or indirect, you experience as a result of using this app.

## App Updates

We may update the app periodically to improve functionality, fix bugs, or meet platform requirements. The app is currently available on Android and iOS - the requirements for these systems may change, and you'll need to download updates if you want to keep using the app.

While we strive to keep the app updated and compatible with current operating systems, we don't guarantee that it will always be updated to be compatible with all versions of Android and iOS. You agree to accept updates to the application when offered to you.

We may also need to stop providing the app, and may terminate use of it at any time without giving advance notice. Unless otherwise stated, upon any termination: (a) the rights and licenses granted to you in these terms will end; (b) you must stop using the app, and (if needed) delete it from your device.

## Changes to Terms and Conditions

We may update our Terms and Conditions from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Terms and Conditions on the project repository. You are advised to review this page periodically for any changes.
