# Terms and Conditions for SuperDuper App

**Effective Date: May 4th, 2025**

## Introduction

These Terms and Conditions ("Terms") govern your use of SuperDuper (the "App"), an open source alternative ebike app available for iOS and Android platforms developed by SuperDuper Team ("we", "our", or "us").

By downloading or using the App, these Terms will automatically apply to you. Please read them carefully before using the App. By using the App, you confirm that you accept these Terms and that you agree to comply with them. If you do not agree to these Terms, you must not download or use the App.

## Definitions

- **App**: The SuperDuper mobile application
- **User**: Any individual who downloads or uses the App
- **Device**: The smartphone or tablet used to access the App
- **Ebike**: Any electric bicycle compatible with the App

## License to Use

SuperDuper is an open source application, with its source code available at [https://github.com/blopker/superduper](https://github.com/blopker/superduper). The app is licensed under open source licensing terms that can be found in the repository. 

This license gives you the right to download and use the App on your personal device(s) and to modify the source code according to the applicable open source license. 

While the App is open source, the project name, logos, and branding elements are protected by intellectual property rights and are not covered by the open source license.

You're welcome to examine and modify the source code according to the applicable open source license, but you may not misrepresent the App as your own or use the SuperDuper brand in a way that implies endorsement.

## User Responsibilities

When using the App, you agree to:

1. Use the App only for its intended purpose of controlling compatible ebikes
2. Use the App in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations
3. Not attempt to gain unauthorized access to any part of the App or servers hosting associated services
4. Not use the App in any way that could damage, disable, overburden, or impair the App or interfere with others' use of the App

## App Functionality and Changes

SuperDuper is committed to providing a useful and efficient app for controlling compatible ebikes. For that reason, we reserve the right to make changes to the App at any time and for any reason. We may update the App for bug fixes, improved compatibility with different devices, or to add new features.

The App is currently provided free of charge and will remain so. However, we make no promises that it will always be available or that it will function exactly as you expect. We may suspend, withdraw, or restrict the availability of all or any part of the App for business and operational reasons.

## Device Security and Compatibility

SuperDuper connects to ebikes using Bluetooth technology. It's your responsibility to keep your device and access to the App secure. We recommend that you do not jailbreak or root your device, which could compromise your device's security and may cause the App to function improperly or not at all.

We recommend using the latest version of your device's operating system to ensure optimal App performance and security.

## Third-Party Services

The App may use third-party services that declare their own Terms and Conditions, including:

* [Google Play Services](https://policies.google.com/terms)
* [Apple App Store Services](https://www.apple.com/legal/internet-services/itunes/)

Your use of these services is governed by their respective terms of service and privacy policies.

## Limitations of Liability

To the maximum extent permitted by law, SuperDuper is provided "as is" without warranty of any kind, express or implied, including but not limited to the warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, title, and non-infringement.

The developers of SuperDuper cannot take responsibility for:

- The App not working at full functionality if you don't have proper Bluetooth connectivity
- Any battery consumption on your device while using the App
- Any issues arising from improper use of the App
- Any damage or modifications to your ebike resulting from use of the App

By using SuperDuper, you accept that connecting to and controlling your ebike is done at your own risk. We accept no liability for any loss, direct or indirect, you experience as a result of using this App.

In no event shall the developers of SuperDuper be liable for any damages whatsoever, including but not limited to any direct, indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any kind, whether in an action of contract, negligence, or other tortious action, arising out of or in connection with the use or inability to use the App.

## App Updates

We may update the App periodically to improve functionality, fix bugs, or meet platform requirements. The App is currently available on Android and iOS - the requirements for these systems may change, and you'll need to download updates if you want to keep using the App.

While we strive to keep the App updated and compatible with current operating systems, we don't guarantee that it will always be updated to be compatible with all versions of Android and iOS. You agree to accept updates to the App when offered to you.

We may also need to stop providing the App, and may terminate use of it at any time without giving advance notice. Unless otherwise stated, upon any termination: (a) the rights and licenses granted to you in these Terms will end; (b) you must stop using the App, and (if needed) delete it from your device.

## Intellectual Property

The App and all associated intellectual property rights, including but not limited to copyright, trademarks, and trade secrets, are owned by the SuperDuper Team. The open source license grants you certain rights to use and modify the code, but it does not transfer ownership of the intellectual property to you.

## Dispute Resolution

These Terms shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of California, without regard to its conflict of law provisions.

Any dispute arising out of or relating to these Terms or the App shall first be attempted to be resolved through informal negotiation. If the dispute cannot be resolved through informal negotiation, it shall be resolved through binding arbitration in accordance with the rules of the American Arbitration Association.

## Severability

If any provision of these Terms is found to be unenforceable or invalid, that provision will be limited or eliminated to the minimum extent necessary so that these Terms will otherwise remain in full force and effect and enforceable.

## Waiver

No waiver of any term of these Terms shall be deemed a further or continuing waiver of such term or any other term, and our failure to assert any right or provision under these Terms shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision.

## Changes to Terms and Conditions

We may update our Terms and Conditions from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Terms and Conditions on the App's website and updating the "Effective Date" at the top of these Terms. You are advised to review this page periodically for any changes.

Your continued use of the App after we post any modifications to the Terms will constitute your acknowledgment of the modifications and your consent to abide and be bound by the modified Terms.
